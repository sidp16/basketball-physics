# Basketball 3PT Shooting Simulation 
## What is this about?
The aim of this project is to offer a user the ability to shoot a basketball into a hoop from the 3 point line by adjusting the force applied, arc of the ball and the position the ball is shot from on the court (corner, wing, top of the key). Once shot, the ball should move and react / bounce on the hoop if the shot was not accurate.
